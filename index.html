		<p>This text is purely here to see if adding a big block of text is what I need for Google AdSense to approve my website for advertising. It keeps telling me no and I have no idea why. It's pretty annoying I'm not going to lie, but hey, there isn't really much I can do about it. Google AdSense doesn't seem to have any support of its own and I don't want to go through the generic Google support because it is so slow that if I did I might kill myself.</p>
